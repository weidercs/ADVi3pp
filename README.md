# ADVi3++, an advanced and better firmware for Wanhao i3 Plus Printers

## Introduction

**ADVi3++** is a fork of the [Marlin Firmware](http://marlinfw.org/) for the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus (and its clones: Monoprice Maker Select Plus, Cocoon Create, ...). It includes both Marlin itself and screens for the LCD Panel.

Working on **ADVi3++** takes a lot of time and effort. I make my best to release good quality software, useful and precise documents. I track bugs reported by users and replies to help requests. I invest also time and money to implement new hardware features.

If you like what I am doing, please consider supporting me as a supporter on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=6504486) so I can continue and develop new releases and new documents. Supporting this project is a guaranty for you that it will continue and become better and better.

## Objectives

The objectives with this custom version (when compared with Wanhao stock firmwares) are the following:

* Based on the latest version of Marlin available (currently: 1.1.9 + post 1.1.9 fixes, 2.0 is on the way)
* As few modifications of the Marlin code as possible. The goal is to be able to port **ADVi3++** to new versions of Marlin with only a few effort.
* Open source code.
* Object-oriented code with as few hard-coded values as possible. For example, instead of constructing a frame by hand, use instances of classes that know how to construct themselves.
* Documented code, logging and error handling (without using exceptions as they are not supported).
* Full color and nice LCD screens.
* Support of hardware such as the BLTouch sensor for automatic bed leveling.
* Etc.

# Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus

I have posted an article on my web site: [Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus 3D Printer - Everything I know about the Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus 3D printer and its clones](http://sebastien.andrivet.com/en/posts/). It contains several technical information about the printer internals.

# Other projects

There are some other projects (I am aware of) on a similar topic:

- [i3plus+](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus) from Leo Lüker (Silverquark): a modified version of the Marlin 1.1.2 firmware for the WANHAO Duplicator i3 Plus 3d printer. **Important**: No more actively developed (that's why I created ADVi3++).

- [i3extra](https://github.com/nepeee/i3Extra) from Nemcsik Péter: a modified version of the Marlin 1.1.0-RC8 firmware and updated LCD resources. **Important**: this project is no more maintained.

- [Wanhao-I3-Plus](https://github.com/jamesarm97/Wanhao-I3-Plus) by James Armstrong: Sources of version 2.18 of Mainboard firmware and LCD resources.

- [Wanhao-I3-Plus](https://github.com/garychen99/Duplicator-i3-plus) by WANHAO 3D PRINTER: Official sources of version 2.1.803 of Mainboard firmware and LCD resources.

# Thanks

Thanks to [Dylan xKoldx](https://github.com/xKoldx/ADVi3pp-Marlin) and [weidercs](https://github.com/weidercs/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for their forks supporting BLTouch. Thanks to Matt Cowell [SureshotM6](https://github.com/SureshotM6/ADVi3pp-Marlin) for the fork supporting M600 and head parking.

Thanks to Leo Lüker (Silverquark) for his [i3plus+ project](https://github.com/Silverquark/i3PlusPlus). I take many ideas from his code. But the project is no more active and I do not like the screens (personal taste) so I have created the **ADVi3++** fork. It is technically a fork of Marlin, not of i3plus+.

Thanks to [MarlinTeam](http://marlinfw.org/) for their great work.
